# Computer-Graphics-Project

Computer-Graphics-Project repository is relative to [Computer Graphics](https://www11.ceda.polimi.it/schedaincarico/schedaincarico/controller/scheda_pubblica/SchedaPublic.do?&evn_default=evento&c_classe=712745&polij_device_category=DESKTOP&__pj0=0&__pj1=f9d83855fa72b2fe459ac56b3d1d98d8) course, held by professor Gribaudo at Politecnico di Milano.

In order to pass the exam we had to carry out 2 main tasks:
* complete 12 assignments based on the different topics seen during classes
* design and develop a 3D game by using WebGL 2.0; in particular ***"Hungry Birds Simulator"*** has been assigned to our group


## Hungry Birds Simulator
The aim of this project was to design and develop a 3D game based on the popular ***"Angry Birds"*** game.


### Game Objective
The game has 2 goals:
1. hit all pigs hidden in the castle with the 5 given birds
2. reach the highest score by hitting and destroying not just pigs but also castle pieces


### Design 
Both Pigs and Birds' assets were given by professor, all other have been created and edited with Blender.
Every time a user starts to play both birds and castle pieces are randomized. 

In particular we added to our game 4 different birds:
* **Red:** he is the basic bird of Angry Birds game and he doesn't have any special power
* **Chuck:** the yellow bird of Angry Birds, he is able to speed up while he is flying 
* **Matilda:** the mother bird, her power is to drop eggs
* **Bomb:** as the name says his power is to explode and hit more pieces during the explosion

The game has 2 different lights' setting, by clicking on the toggle button is is possible to switch between day and night.
